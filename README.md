# Project Overview
Group Payment DApp is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to manage group payments efficiently using the Ethereum blockchain. This DApp allows users to create groups, contribute payments, check payment statuses, and distribute funds among participants. Built using Web3.js and smart contracts on Ethereum, it aims to simplify and secure group transactions without the need for intermediaries.

# Features:
## Create Group:
A group creator can define a list of participants (Ethereum addresses) and a total payment amount.
## Make Payment:
Group members can contribute their portion to the group's total payment.
## Check Payment:
Group members can check their individual contributions.
## Distribute Payments:
The creator can distribute the collected payments to all participants once the group payment is complete.

# Tech Stacks

## Frontend:
### HTML, CSS, JavaScript: 
The user interface (UI) of the application is built using these web development technologies to provide a responsive and interactive experience.
### Bootstrap: 
If any additional styling or layout was used for form and button styling.

# Backend:
### Solidity: 
The smart contracts that govern the group payment logic are written in Solidity, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
### Ganache: 
Local Ethereum blockchain for testing purposes.
### MetaMask:
For connecting and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
### Web3.js:
The Web3.js library is used to connect the frontend with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
### Smart Contracts:
Contracts manage group creation, payment, and distribution functionalities.

The testing video shows the desired working of problem statement in terminal, we tried running it by makig a UI website but there seems to be a problem with the app.js file but still the desired result is given by code.
